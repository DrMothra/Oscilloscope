            Welcome to the oscilloscope application page, here you'll find all the instructions to visualise your data.<br>
            At the moment the app will only visualise data from pubnub, hopefully in the future it will visualise data from other sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter the name of the relevant pubnub channel in the channel name at the top left and press enter.<br>
            You'll then receive a message asking you to wait until the app has retrieved all the information from pubnub about your channel.<br>
            If this is successful then the stream names will become populated with the relevant information.<br>
            If you then click the Enable button next to the relevant stream then you should see the data being displayed, with the numeric value shown in the black box.
        </p>
        <p>
            The jogger wheels do the following:<br>
            Amplitude - scales the output accordingly<br>
            Time - scales the time axis accordingly<br>
            Y-Shift - moves the data up and down the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you can't see your data and one of the arrows is illuminated next to your enabled channel then it means that the values are beyond the currently displayed limits.<br>
            If you adjust the Amplitude jogger wheel then it should come into view, or alternatively use the Y-Shift to move the data around the screen.
